# DSD(Digital System Design)


Here in this repositories, I tried some mini project about digital system design in logisim software.

Here, I tried to do 
1. Simple ALU circuit using full adder. This full adder also created in logisim with basic gates.
2. ALU circuit and its logic operations.
3. Creatig buffer register and then connect them to bus.

This taks were my digital system lab assignments.
